<h1>Code Structure</h1>

Code matching our detailed class diagram is found within the BackEnd Directory.

The 25 unit tests are executed to test backend methods.

Differenes between class diagram and backend code can be found at the top of each backend file.

Front End directory is used for the demonstration of our product.

<h1>Running Tests</h1>

Code is written in python3.

You might need to run the following to resolve dependencies: 

"pip install pygame"

"pip install scipy" 

"pip install numpy" 

"pip install Django"

"pip install djangorestframework"

Alternatively you can install all of the requirements by running

"pip install -r requirements.txt"

This uses the requirements.txt in the root directory of the repository to install dependencies

run UnitTest.py from the command line using "python UnitTest.py" from within the
SoftwareDesign_Assignment5 folder.  

(use pip3 and python3 if on mac or linux or you already have python as python2)
